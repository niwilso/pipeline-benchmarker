# Pipeline Benchmarking

This directory contains code (`mlops` and `pipelinebenchmarker`) and documentation (`docs`) for benchmarking Azure Machine Learning (AML) pipelines.

For an example of how to implement the `PipelineBenchmarker` class in an AML pipeline, please refer to the `mlops/example_pipeline` and `docs` directories.
